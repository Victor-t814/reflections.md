# Week 2 Summary

* What I learned and what it means 
>From this weeks tutorials I gathered useful foundational/entry level git commands. one of the big ones to me was the cloning. Being able to create something on github and then pulling that down to the terminal/cli/shell will be a major stepping stone moving forward. all while being able to edit with "code . ". and adding messages with "git commit -m" and then pusing it back to github with "git push"

* what is terminal?
>a terminal is a text-based interface where cammands can be run and it allows us to do more things than the gui will allow. This is important because its like the foundation of coding. This allows us to manipulate files.
* what is git and git hub?
>a git is a VCS (version control system) and this allow you to track the changes youve made to your code over time. While github is a services that hosts those git repositories.
* how would i anticipate these tools helo someone working as a developer?
>well, Gits are ideal for teamworking. with it being a VCS its nice for developers to work on the same code concurrently and git is especially popular with its comprehensive ability to track changes and progress. Github creates an inviroment that holds it all together for even greater team building code. It is also provides a platform to just share code and create almost a "linkedin" for developers.
